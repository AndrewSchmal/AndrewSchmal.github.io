        <ul>
            <li><strong>Personal Background:</strong> Born and raised in IL, moved to NC in 2018.</li>
            <li><strong>Professional Background:</strong> When I took a break from school for a bit to focus on working to save up money, I was a retail manager for a while. Decided I definitely wanted to change fields after realizing that wasn’t for me so I came back to school.</li>
            <li><strong>Academic Background:</strong> I’m a senior going for my B.S. in Computer Science with the default Software, Systems, and Networks concentration. Still undecided on what I want to do for a career but leaning towards software engineering.</li>
            <li><strong>Programming/Software Background:</strong> Took a Goodwill training course on JavaScript before I started at UNCC, but that was a while ago! Looking forward to this class after having taken all the Intro to CS prereqs and Data Structures/Software Engineering.</li>
            <li><strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong> Windows Desktop at home, laptop at school.</li>
            <li><strong>Courses I’m Taking, & Why:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>ITIS-3135 - Web App Design and Development:</strong> Concentration elective, but I also would like more programming experience and this class should give me a few projects for my portfolio.</li>
                    <li><strong>MATH-1242 - Calculus II:</strong> Required for major (<em>sadly</em>). But just stats after this, almost done with math.</li>
                    <li><strong>ITCS-4145 - Parallel Programming:</strong> Concentration elective. But again, this semester I really want to improve my programming skills and this course looks interesting.</li>
                    <li><strong>ITCS-3112 - Design and Implementation of Object-Oriented Systems:</strong> Concentration elective. Heard from many that this was one of the easier electives you could take, which seems true. Easier than any compsci class I took after data structures for sure.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Other stuff to share:</strong> If you wanna add me on LinkedIn, feel free. I’m trying to network and expand connections on there.</p>
